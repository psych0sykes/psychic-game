## Take a Guess!
The app is listening for keystrokes, so hit an alphabet key on your keyboard to start guessing letters. Each word you complete will increase your score. But if you make 12 incorrect guesses before completing a wor, you lose! The score then resets to zero.

## What I Learned
Using javascript to take interactions from the user, and create and update components on the html page.
